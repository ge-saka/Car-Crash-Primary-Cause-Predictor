Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classifier capable of predicting the primary contributory cause of car accidents in Chicago. The insights derived from this classifier will enable the City of Chicago and the Vehicle Safety Board to implement targeted interventions to enhance road safety.
Stakeholders
City of Chicago: Traffic management and road safety departments will utilize the insights to improve traffic safety measures.
Vehicle Safety Board: This board will use the data to formulate policies, launch safety campaigns, and improve vehicular regulations.
Business Problem
The high rate of car accidents in Chicago presents a significant business problem. By identifying and understanding the leading causes of these accidents, the city can implement specific interventions such as:
Enhancing road infrastructure.
Introducing stricter traffic regulations.
Running educational campaigns targeting high-risk behaviors.
Improving emergency response protocols.
